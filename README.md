# UKMARSEY Command Language

This is a real-time command language for low level I/O micros of mobile robots, and first with the UKMARSBOT Robot. 

The commands are terse but intended to be entered either by human via a 
terminal or via machine, e.g. a Pi Zero. It's intention is to allow real-time 
command loops of low level operations, or high-level control for less experienced users.

NOTE: Originally this project was intended as a wall follower for the UKMARSBOT robot, but it only got as far as a hardware test command line via a simple command line interpreter before it was repurposed.

# Getting Started

Loads into Arduino via serial lead from the Arduino IDE. You can issue commands to get the robot to do things.

As well as directly commanding the robot over the serial port, it's designed to be controlled from a host CPU which can be anything 
but we've been using it with the Raspberry Pi.

# Robot Configuration

Even though the UKMarsBot is a standard design, there are several options:

1. The gearbox ratio
2. The wiring of left and right motors
3. The wiring of the encoders
4. The wheel size.

These can be configured in the file 'robot_config.h'. See that file and make appropriate adjustments.

(If you are using low level control from a Raspberry Pi, you might be able to adjust for these in the Raspberry Pi. But if you are using any mid- or high-level control, you will definitely needÂ§ to adjust this file!)


# Summary of Interpreter Usage

NOTICE: This document reflects version 1.2 of the interpreter.

## Serial Connection and Command Entry

Baud rate is 115200, 8N1 bit format (8-bits, no parity, and 1-stop bit).

Once connected you should get a prompt like on reset:

    Hello from ukmarsey

No spaces, tabs or other control characters (below value 32) are allowed in commands, except for those mentioned below in 'Special Control Characters' below, and their use is undefined and may change in future versions of the interpreter. (Technically UTF-8 characters are ok, but none are currently used in commands).

All serial commands are case sensitive. Each command needs to have a LF (10, 0x0D) at the end of it. 

Values are in decimal, but if the value is out of range then interpreter will either issue an error, ignore extra values or interpret this in an undefined way. This last two options are considered undefined operation - and future changes of the interpreter might change the behaviour. Examples are D11= (no value), D11=2 (out of range setting of an I/O port, might throw an error.), D11=100 (out of range, might ignore 00) or D1=-3 (unexpected minus, probably error).

Any commands that return values is done on a seperate line per command. The ends of these lines returned from the interpreter contain a CR LF (0x0D 0x0A).

## Special Control Characters

* Control-X (0x18) - Soft-Reset - same as Control-C, but stops motors, and any active commands. (Same as 'x' command). 
* Control-C (0x03) - Abort entry of line. NOTICE: Character subsequent to this character will be treated as the start of a new line.
* Line Feed (LF, 0x10) - Finish line entry and send to the interpreter. 
* Carriage Return (CR, 0x13) - Ignored by interpreter.
* Backspace (0x08) - Removes one character from input buffer, assuming input buffer has any characters in. Generates "\x08 \x08" which should step back, erase, then step back. However on some serial terminal emulators this might need to be enabled (e.g. on CoolTerm this option is 'Handle BS and Del Characters').

## Serial Commands List

Note: 'x' command stops the motors in the case of runaway, but requires a newline (LF/0x10) afterwards. If you are using a serial terminal emulator (as opposed to Arduino Serial Monitor) you can also use Control-X to stop a runaway.


### Interpreter Control Commands

| Cmd | Action    |
|:---:|-----------|
| ^ | reset state | 
| v | show version |
| V | Verbose error code, 1=verbose (default), 0=numeric - see 'Interpreter errors'.  |
| E | Serial echo of input 0=off, 1=on (default). Generally should be turned off for machines |


Examples:

    V0      Verbose off (numeric error codes)
    V1      Verbose on (text error codes)
    E0      Echo input back (for humans with serial terminals)
    E1      Don't echo input back (for machines, or for use with Arduino Serial monitor)


### Low Level I/O Control Commands

| Cmd | Params     | Action    |
|:---:|------------|-----------|
|  D  | Dp or Dp=n | Set or read digital pin |
|  A  | Aa or Ap=n | Read analogue pin, or write PWM pin |
|  M  | Mm=p       | Motor control, using PWM value. 1 = left motor, 0 or 2 = right motor. PWM value -255 to 255, with 0 as stop. |
|  N  | Nm,n       | Dual motor control specifying a battery voltage | 
|  P  | Pp=d       | PinMode - Set up GPIO pins; p is pin, d is I(input) or O(output) or U(Pull Up Input)  |

Regarding analogue readings, (A command), please see the information in 'Dev Notes'.

Examples:

Setting digital output pins requires no response. It is assumed to simply 'work'.

    D6=1            set pin 3 to logic one
    D13=0           set pin 13 to logic zero

Reading digital input pins returns a single character '0' or '1' for the pin state

    D4              might return '0'

Reading an analogue pin returns an integer in the range 0..1023

    A2              might return '76'
    A0              read analogue pin 0

Write to a PWM output. NOTE: PWM use digital I/O numbering! Range 0..255.

    A9=255          write PWM pin 3, with 255.

Output a motor PWM duty cycle from the range 0..1023. (Or 0..99 or whatever range is agreed)

    M1=45           returns nothing
    M1=255          full PWM forwards left motor
    M2=0            PWM = 0, effectively off
    M2=-128         Half PWM backwards, right motor
    M0=128          Right motor

N command also controls the motors, however it's referenced to battery which means we can avoid differnt speeds as the battery discharges - and instead specify voltages rather than PWM (which is in fact a proportion of the current battery voltage). The general format is 'Nf,g' where f and g are signed floats representing voltage levels, negative backwards, positive forward. 

    N3.5,-3.5       Left motor 3.5 volts, right motor backwards 3.5 volts
    N0,0            Stop both motors

The advantage of this command is that it will go the same speed regardless of battery level, assuming you keep values to the range underneath the minimum battery voltage expected. 

The Pin mode commands allows the user to configure pins.

    P6=O            Configure right LED on wall follower board to Output
    P11=O           Configure left LED on wall follower board to Output

You can how turn the left and right LEDs on and off:

    D11=1
    D11=0
    D6=0
    D6=1

To switch them back to inputs:

    P6=I            Stop driving the right LED
    P11=I           Stop driving the led LED


### Motor Count commands

Reading an encoder counter might be more involved. It is the total so far and the range is int32 (+/- 2,147m even at 1000 counts per mm!). Result or parameter is signed.

| Cmd | Action    |
|:---:|-----------|
| C0 | Read right wheel counter, also possible to use C2 |
| C1 | Read Left wheel counter. Might return the left wheel counter as '-3752901'. |
| C*n*=*m* | Set the Wheel count value, usually. e.g. C1=0 where n=1 and m=0. |
| C  | Alone with no parameters - prints both encoders as 'left,right' |
| z | zero wheel encoder counters. No return. | 
| e | print wheel current info - human readable NOT for machine parsing! |
| r | print encoder setup - human readable NOT for machine parsing! | 

Setting a counter using 'C' command is usually to zero but could be any legal value. Therefore a quick 'z' command is provided.


### Sensor Processing commands

It's sometimes necessary, with Infra-red sensors, to read the IR sensor 'dark', turn on IR illumination, take another IR sensor reading ('light') then turn the IR illumination off. 

These commands provide the ability to specify up to three output ports for IR illumination, and read up to size sensors. 

By default this is set up to read A0, A1, A2, A3 as sensors and use D12 to turn on the IR illumination with a logic 1 , which will work for the standard line and wall followers of the UKMARSBot (although the wall follower doesn't use A3).

| Cmd | Action    |
|:---:|-----------|
|  S  | Read sensors dark values then light values seperated by commas. |
|  *  | Enable/Disable emitter LED Control. Used to save power. |


Examples of output:

    0,0,0,142,28,32,486,352         <- wall close

    0,0,0,4,28,13,15,11            <- no wall


Examples of Emitter control:

    *1
    S
        0,0,0,131,135,25,440,318
    *0
    S
        0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1

### Parameter Commands

Parameters select specific characteristics of high level commands. They are stored in EEPROM so are preserved on power off, especially for human users. 

| Cmd | Action    |
|:---:|-----------|
| $*n* | Read parameter *n* |    
| $*n*=*f* | Write parameter *n* with value *f*. E.g. $0=1.1 |
| $a   | Read all floating parameters seperate lines per parameter. |
| $b   | Read all boolean (bit) parameters, as 32 seperate lines. |
| $d   | Default all parameters. |

NOTE: $a and $b will incur serial buffering and block until complete 

Currently all parameters are floating point values. 

A List of specific usage of each parameters is here.

| Param | Action    |
|:-----:|-----------|
| 0 | *Undefined* |
| 1 | *Undefined*  |
| 2 | *Undefined*  |
| 3 | *Undefined*  |

| 11 | *Undefined*  |
| 12 | *Undefined*  |
| 13 | *Undefined*  |
| 14 | *Undefined*  |
| 15 | *Undefined*  |

### High Level I/O Control
 
(to be added) 

### General Commands

| Cmd | Action    |
|:---:|-----------|
| l |  (lower case L) Led on/off, l0 = led off, l1 = led on. (Short version of D13=x) |
| ? | just prints 'OK' |
| h | just prints 'OK' |
| s | shows the state of the switches. Returns a single number. NOTE: the Button is '16', and overrides the 4 switches | 
| b | shows the voltage of the battery. Example return '7.421' |
| m | motor tests (see below) | 
| x | Motor stop (no parameters, no return.) - and cancels any actions |


### Test commands

m = motor tests, runs for 2 seconds or until button is pressed.
**NOTE: These are for human testing and are NOT for machine control!**

|Command|Function| Action                              |

## Resetting and getting the Pi in sync with the Arduino.

Send Control-C (or Control-X) followed by ^ repeatedly with a 20ms gap until you receive a RST message. Then try ? and v looking at the responses. If they don't succeeed, then repeat the entire sequence. 

This is under review. 


## Interpreter Errors

Interpreter error text strings (verbose on) are not defined to be stable across versions. Numeric error codes (verbose off) will be stable across releases as far as possible. 

NOTE: All error messages (both verbose text and numeric are preceeded by '@Error:' as the first characters on the line, except for verbose error for OK, which appears simply as 'OK' on the line.

OK was left for compatbility with older versions (and it sort of makes sense, since it's not strictly an error as such). This message is only generated by specific commands - generally commands are silent when they succeed. OK can be considered command output, although it will change if verbose is off to an Error style code ('@Error:0').

NOTE: This makes Error codes a special case of unsolicited return messages - see below.

```
enum
{
  T_OK = 0,
  T_OUT_OF_RANGE = 1,
  T_READ_NOT_SUPPORTED = 2,
  T_LINE_TOO_LONG = 3,
  T_UNKNOWN_COMMAND = 4,
  T_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN = 5
};
```

### Examples:

    OK
    @Error:0
    @Error:1
    @Error:5
    @Error:Out of range

## Other messages - Unsolicited return messages
Apart from the start up message, any other messages **that are not caused by a command** have a @ before them and are on a seperate line.

For example:

|Message| Cause                               |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| @Defaulting Params | Shown when there was a problem loading parameters on boot. |

NOTE: Interpreter Error codes also have this format ('@Error:') - see Interpreter Errors.

## Other internal settings and hidden information

| Setting | Cause                               |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
|floating_decimal_places = 3 | Number of floating point decimal places printed. |

# History and Other Notes

It bares some resemblance in some places to G-code (and implementations like grbl), but does not attempt to maintain any G-code compatability, since really G-code is targetted at CNC not really at self-moving small robots.

Since this runs on an ATMEG328P Arduino Nano, there is not much Flash or RAM, so things like help and extended error messages have been minimised. 

We aim to have shortened the amount of bytes requiring to be transmitted in order to maximise the bandwidth across the serial link, while still allowing for easy human entry via a text terminal.


# Dev Notes

There are three subsystems running all the time currently: battery reading, function switch reading and update sensors control. This shoudl be changed so these subsystems are optional. 

NOTE: The battery reading, function switch reading and update sensors control use analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). The Arduino Nano has one 10-bit analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Therefore, it is not practical to use the ADC from the converter and from the interrupts. You therefore either need to turn off the interrupt usage, or avoid using the ADC directly from the command line interpreter (CLI).
